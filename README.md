# Fraudulent or Legitimate: Exploring Anomaly Detection in Credit Card Transactions

The purpose of this project is to design anomaly detection models to combat credit card fraud through machine learning techniques. Our objective is to build a precise anomaly detection model and reduce false positives.

## Algorithms Employed

We employed unsupervised learning algorithms like:

- **ISOLATION FOREST**
- **K-MEANS CLUSTERING**
- **LOCAL OUTLIER FACTOR (LOF)**
- **ONE CLASS SVM**
